![Serverless Workflow Specification](specification/media/sw-logo.png)

Serverless Workflow Specification defines the model for Workflows
responsible for orchestrating event-driven, serverless applications.

Main goals of the specification include:

- Facilitate Serverless Workflow portability across different vendor platforms
- Be completely vendor neutral
- Support both stateless and stateful Serverless Workflow orchestration
- Define a light-weight and powerful Serverless Workflow model

Serverless Workflow is hosted by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation's](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF) [Serverless Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless). 
It was proposed as a Cloud Native sandbox level project on [March 3, 2020](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/376).
